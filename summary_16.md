# 16 From Manual to automation Testing
# Resume

### Manual Testing
- Test cases are executed by a human tester and software 
- Objective : Exploratory and Human observation 
- Why manual : * Exploratory * Velocity * Usability
- Pros of Manual testing : * Get fast and accurate Visual feedback * It is less expensive as you don't need to speed your budget for the automation tools and process
			   * While testing a small change an automation test would require coding which could be time comsuming. While you could test manually on the fly.
- Cons of Manual Testing : * It always prone to mistake & errors * can't be recorded so it not possible to reuse the manual test

### Automation Testing 
- Using an automation tool to execute your test case suite.
- Objective : efficiency and coverage
- Why Automation testing : * Flexibility * Velocity * Coverage * Error - advoidance
- Which test case to Automate : * Test causes that are executed repeatedly * test cases that are very tedious or difficult to perform manually
				* Test cases which are time-consuming to perform manually.
- Which test case NOT to Automate : * Test cases that are newly designed and not executed manually at least once
				    * Test cases for which the requirements are frequently changing.
- Automate Testing Process : 1. Test tool selection 2. Define scope of automation 3. Planning design and development 4. Test execution 5. Maintenance
- Test Tool Selection : * Usability * Simolicity * Cost

### Define Scope of Automation
- Scope of automation is the area of your application under test which will be automated

### Planning, Design and Development
- During this phase you create automation strategy & plan then develop the automation script.

### Test Execution
- Automation script are executed during this phase.

### Maintenance
- Automation script need to be added, reviewed,and maintained for each cycle.

### Automation Best Practices 
- Scope of automation needs to be detemined in detail, this sets expectations from automation right.
- Select the right automation tool
- Scipting standards. standards have to be followed while writing the scipt for automations,
- Measure metrics. Success of automation cannot be determined by comparing the manual effort with the automation effort.
